## Abstract
This project presents a thorough analysis of the Exacens dataset, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data modeling. The team applied various data science techniques to ensure the reliability of the analysis and gain valuable insights from the dataset. The modeling phase involved the experimentation with different machine learning models, with a detailed evaluation of their performance. The selected best-performing model is justified based on its alignment with the dataset characteristics.
